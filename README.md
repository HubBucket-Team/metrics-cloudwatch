CloudWatch integration for codahale metrics
===========================================

This is my own port of [blacklocus/metrics-cloudwatch](https://github.com/blacklocus/metrics-cloudwatch) project.

This fork adds support for reporter-wide (global) dimensions.
The rationale and use case are described in my original pull request: <https://github.com/blacklocus/metrics-cloudwatch/pull/12>.

Apart of the reporter-wide dimensions this version has different Maven group and was published to Maven Central as:
`com.gihub.lukaszbudnik.metrics-cloudwatch:metrics-cloudwatch:0.3.6`.
